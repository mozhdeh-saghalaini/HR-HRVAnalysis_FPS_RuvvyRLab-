The data_wrangling and data_merging codes are prepared mostly based on the Zoom recordings' details of the MindWare output formats, thus they requrie careful checking of the output structure such as sheets and row numbers. Also the subjective data we have needs to be checked and we should update the codes accordingly.
I am now working on preparing a code for statistical analysis we want to implement based on our initial hypotheses.
